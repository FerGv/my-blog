# Welcome

Hi, this is my personal blog. Here you can find some interesting things about programming that can be useful, maybe ðŸ˜….

This blog is for you and for the future me, since I will post about what I learn, what I am into or the challenges I have to struggle to on my every day as a software developer ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’».

Also, it is a good chance to start improving my writing skill in Spanish and English (if you are reading this, so I finally released the multi-language version ðŸ˜€). If you find any mistake, please let me know by sending me a pull request to my repo (link on footer).

See you on the next article. Happy coding! ðŸ¥¸
